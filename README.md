# L3pgeprojects

**This repository contains the work done in my first year in the Grande Ecole Program at SKEMA Business School (Data Science & AI curriculum).**

*All the codes generated within this repository are written in R language.*

The [Coronavirus](https://github.com/ValHrt/L3pgeprojects/tree/master/Coronavirus) folder contains codes using Mr Krispin's coronavirus API in order to model the propagation of the Covid-19 virus throughout the world. This work was then further developed in a Hackathon organized by SKEMA Global Lab in AI, you can find this code [here](https://github.com/warint/covid-19/blob/master/team11/FinalDocument.Rmd).

The [CountryReportCh](https://github.com/ValHrt/L3pgeprojects/tree/master/CountryReportCH) folder contains a country report (on Switzerland) made in the framework of an evaluation for the DataScience & AI course. This [report](https://github.com/ValHrt/L3pgeprojects/blob/master/CountryReportCH/CountryReportCH.Rmd) makes use of numerous API (WorldBank, WDI, OECD, Eurostat, ...).

The [Geopolitique](https://github.com/ValHrt/L3pgeprojects/tree/master/Geopolitique) folder is a FlexDashboard produced as part of the geopolitics course at SKEMA Business School. This [FlexDashboard](https://github.com/ValHrt/L3pgeprojects/blob/master/Geopolitique/FlexDashBresil.Rmd) aims at demonstrating the regional and global power of Brazil.

The [MarketResearch](https://github.com/ValHrt/L3pgeprojects/tree/master/MarketResearch) folder is a study carried out for the Etablissement Fran√ßais du Sang. This [study](https://github.com/ValHrt/L3pgeprojects/blob/master/MarketResearch/DataEFS.Rmd) was carried out on the basis of a survey circulated to more than 3000 respondents and aimed at analysing the blood type of individuals according to their place of birth as well as the place of birth of their parents. In addition, I also carried out an analysis of attitudes towards blood donation.

The [TestCourseBigData](https://github.com/ValHrt/L3pgeprojects/tree/master/TestCourseBigData) folder contains the codes used in the SKEMA Business School Big Data course. In particular, I performed [correlation tests](https://github.com/ValHrt/L3pgeprojects/blob/master/TestCourseBigData/NYtest.Rmd), [principal component analysis](https://github.com/ValHrt/L3pgeprojects/blob/master/TestCourseBigData/MineralWater.Rmd) and [clustering tests](https://github.com/ValHrt/L3pgeprojects/blob/master/TestCourseBigData/FootData.Rmd) with files provided by our teacher.

The other folders or files in this repository are test files that were made to improve my skills or to store code that could be useful to me in the future.

All these files / documents were made between February and June 2020.
